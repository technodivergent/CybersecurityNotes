Using hashes gained from [[SMB Relay Attacks]] or [[LLMNR Poisoning]] we can get a shell using the `ntlmrelayx.py` but we can also use `psexec` found in:

1. Metasploit (`exploit/windows/smb/psexec`)
	1. send a reverse shell
	2. experiment with different targets
2. Impacket (`/opt/impacket/examples/psexec.py`)
3. `smbexec.py`
4. `wmiexec.py`
