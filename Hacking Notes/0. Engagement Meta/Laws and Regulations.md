# Precautionary Measures During Penetration Tests

We have prepared a list of precautions we highly recommend following during each penetration test to avoid violating most laws. In addition, we should also be aware that some countries have additional regulations that apply to specific cases, and we should either inform ourselves or ask our lawyer.

1. Obtain written consent from the owner or authorized representative of the computer or network being tested
2. Conduct the testing within the scope of the consent obtained only and respect any limitations specified
3. Take measures to prevent causing damage to the systems or networks being tested
4. Do not access, use or disclose personal data or any other information obtained during the testing without permission
5. Do not intercept electronic communications without the consent of one of the parties to the communication
6. Do not conduct testing on systems or networks that are covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) without proper authorization
