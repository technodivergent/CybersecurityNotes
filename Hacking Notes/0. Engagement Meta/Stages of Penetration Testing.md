## Scoping Questionnaire
Helps us understand what client wants. Client name, key personnel/contact info, etc
Services such as internal vs external, VA or PT, app/web, red team, etc

Additional questions might include:
- How many live hosts?
- IPs/CIDRs in range?
- Domains/Subdomains in scope?
- Wireless SSIDs in scope
- If phishing, who will be targeted? Client list or OSINT?
- Web/mobile apps?
- Separate AD assessment desired?
- Testing done from anon user on network or standard domain user?
- Bypass network access control?
What information will be provided to testers? Black box, grey, etc

Non-evasive, hybrid, fully evasive?

## Pre-engagement Meeting
Discusses all relevant and essential components with client before engagement. Information gathered during this meeting along with the scoping questionnaire will help build the **Penetration Testing Proposal** or **Scope of Work**.

## Kick off meeting
Scheduled after all contracts have been signed. Includes client POC from internal audit, infosec, IT, GRC, technical support staff, and testing team.

Typically if a critical vuln is ID'd during external assessment, pause the test, notify emergency contacts.

Internal typically only paused when system becomes unresponsive, evidence of illegal activity is found (e.g., illegal content on file share), or presence of an external threat actor or prior breach.

Must inform of potential risks (logs, alarms, locking out legitimate users)
